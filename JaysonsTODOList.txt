Make form (ProfileManager) properly submit:
	make database submit everything for creation, currently only prepared statements work
	make database update things on the form, again using prep-statements 

change form degree variables so they can be edited


Large tasks:

Create a profile homepage which indexes all of the profiles in the database

create an install script/instructions (maybe one that uses ANT) (may not be possible)

Create documentation for Next group

change LDAP authentication to only allow professors to make profiles.
(test with brinkman)


//User Views:
Profiles:
	if users page exists
		load page
	else
		"This page cannot be found"
		Link to profile home

profileManager:
	create:
	if the person isn't logged in
		show a generic message
	
	If the person is logged in:
		if they do have a profile:
		Profile edit:
			if they do have a profile
				load the form, but with all boxes filled with current information
				allow for the same functionality as create, but with full input boxes
		
		if they don't have a profile:
		Do form stuff
		when form is submitted, redirect to profile
	

ProfilesHome:

generic message

If person is logged in:
	if person has profile:
		link to profile edit
	else
		link to profile create

list of people









Tasks for next group:
Integrate this with dspace's very shallow profiles system
refactor the class system of our current setup so there is not so much code reuse
